----@def removePokemon
    _pokemon: This represents the list of Pok√©mon.
    The expression _pokemon.filterNot(_ == pokemonToRemove) is a concise way of filtering out elements from the _pokemon list that are equal to pokemonToRemove. Here's how it works:
     .filterNot(...): This is a higher-order function applied to the _pokemon list. It takes a predicate function as an argument and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the predicate returns false.
    _ == pokemonToRemove: This is a shorthand notation for a function literal that compares each element of the _pokemon list with pokemonToRemove. Here, _ represents each individual element of the list, and pokemonToRemove is the element we want to remove.
    The expression _ == pokemonToRemove returns true if the current element (_) is equal to pokemonToRemove, and false otherwise.
